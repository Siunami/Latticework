Ok so to map out the next steps

Figure out the state data structure for keeping sidebar references. Because I need to update their positions, change their look (comment expansion) based on resize events in the window.

- I think I literally just keep a list of these items. Then filter the list depending on the active window event, and modify accordingly.
  - maybe I'm moving it left or right. Or expanding to view comment or highlight inline. This will be a portal

I also need to consider syncing of the hover and cursor states.

Flow:

- Cursor next to reference icon, show the connection. If tab with the page is already open, save the state that the tab began in. When cursor leaves, revert back to that state.
  - This includes what tab was originally focused and where the peek tab was originally scrolled to.
- If hover, then do the same thing, save cursor state, show the mouseover hover. Hover reverts to where the cursor is highlighting if it exists. Otherwise, it will go back to original state

So flow consists of

- save all necessary state to recreate some editor state before going into peek mode (either cursor or hover)
- show peek. Click to keep peek open, losing original state.
- or unpeek and go back to original state
