## Finished core plugin

- Ability to create a copy with reference
- Ability to hover over reference to see where it came from in peek mode
- Ability to click to keep the reference as a tab in view

## Things that haven't been completed

- I want to understand if I can sync in real time control between two panels (((I want to understand if I can sync in real time control between two panels|Obsidian Plugin.md|18,0|18,74)))
  - SVG styling (((Insert SVG, length based on number of characters, logarithmic.|Obsidian Plugin.md|28,0|28,62)))
- I need to carefully sync the start and end states of the plugin.
  - I should prob try to do this tonight
- AI settings
  - Perform a query across the entire obsidian database
  - Perform a query on a single obsidian document
- Uh.. reference the title?

### Considerations

Want to consider the case where you write something first, then type the parenthesis. You want to then select some chunk of text (((Want to consider the case where you write something first, then type the parenthesis. You want to then select some chunk of text|Obsidian Plugin.md|74,0|74,128)))

- I've replaced this with CMD-Shift-D copy action.

### Bugs

- Bug when the hover item is referencing something in the same document. The Obsidian `detach` function sometimes triggers before the `replaceRange` codemirror call can complete. So the highlight range is left in the document when it should be removed.
  - potential solution: I could move the replaceRange call in this particular case to the still open editor.

## Major things left to do

- Need to gracefully handle changes to a referenced piece of text
  - If referenced text chunk changes, then degrade reference to a page reference
- Need to figure out UI to make the source and reference connection clearer
- AI component
  - I think this will make the plugin feel really amazing
